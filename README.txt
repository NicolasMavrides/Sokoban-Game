Sokoban Game -- Made by Nicolas Mavrides #
                                         #
##########################################

This mini-game was originally coded a year before I released it to public domain as part
of a University Assignment in my first year (back when I'd only just started programming Ruby),
but never actually finished completely.

This is the completed, fixed version of the game and should work 100% as it should. To play, run
the sokoban.rb file using command prompt and follow the instructions given by the splash screen.

Code is free for use and redistribution.
